# An Introduction to an Introduction to *Nix

## Learning *nix

This is the present home of an effort to combine course notes for the System Level Programming course at Georgia State University into an Intro to *Nix textbook.

The System Level Programming course mainly covers Unix (in a broad sense) and the C language, using "Unix for PRogrammers and Developers" for the Unix part, and C Programming: A Modern Approach for the C part.
The Unix book in particular, though a good book, has begun to show it's age; it covers many tools that are no longer in wide use (like lpr!), and does not cover newer tools.
Many of the instructors for the course pick and choose from the book, and frequently do units on topics not covered in either text - such as C++ or Python.
It was decided that one text should be produced, based on the curricula of the different courses, containing all of the content in a reasonably ordered presentation, that is designed to hang together as one course.
(Besides producing a text that would fit exactly our uses, it will also help us to organize exactly one consistant curriculum for the course!)

As a second use case, many people - not just GSU students! - frequently find themselves staring at an SSH session, logged into a machine in "the cluster" at their work place, with no idea how to proceed.
Clearly, there is a demand for a clear, updated text that concisely explains the basics of how one "does work" at a Unix terminal.
So, while our major use is as a text for a class, we also hope to produce a servicable general introduction to Unix.

## Pedagogery

It should be noted that, beyond simply introducing students to Unix, the GSU course also serves several other pedagogical goals - that is, it is also used to set up for other topics.
Understanding these other (usually unstated) goals will help one understand the use of the text.

- *It's Not All Java!* Many students' first CS courses revolve around learning to program in Java; these students frequently come away from these courses believing that Java will be the presumptive language of all future coursework.
This book is anticipated to have short introductions to *many* other programming languages; this is not an accident.  While Unix has a long history of embracing a diversity of narrowly-construed, task-specific languages, it is specifically useful to include them in this book as a sort of "wake-up call" to students that their entire education will *not* use Java exclusively.
- *Operating System Design* This book should also be one of the first places where students see topics like "the kernel," "processes" and "the file system" discussed in a formal manner.
Ideally, this should serve as a set-up for a more thorough treatment of the topic in an Operating System Principles course later.

# Contributions

We definitely want this to be a useful text for many people, and as such, we welcome contributions from readers, teachers and enthusiasts.
However, it should be noted that we also specifically wish this to be a primary textbook for a course at our university; therefore, the more ably a contribution can be integrated into our general curriculum and structure, the more likely it is to be accepted.

It's also worth noting, of course, that this project is in the very early stages of development, so there isn't much to see right now - and rough edges, errors and omissions are a guarantee.

And of course, before everything is finished, it will be moved to a different github.io page, probably one for either GSU as an organization, or for Dr. Robert Harrison's research group, the members of which are actually producing this thing.
